# Python Machine Learning Cookbook
Visualforce Development Cookbook by Packt

##Instructions and Navigation
This is the code repository for [Visualforce Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786464477), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish. The code files are organized according to the chapters in the book. These code samples will work on any machine running Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. Even though they are written and tested on Python 2.7, you can easily run them on Python 3.x with minimal changes.

To run the code samples, you need to install [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), [NumPy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/install.html), and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html). For Chapter 6, you will need to install [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/install.html) and [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html). To run the code in chapter 7, you need to install [hmmlearn](http://hmmlearn.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [python_speech_features](http://python-speech-features.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). For chapter 8, you need to install [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html) and [PyStruct](https://pystruct.github.io/installation.html). Chapter 8 also makes use of hmmlearn. For chapters 9 and 10, you need to install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html). For chapter 11, you need to install [NeuroLab](https://pythonhosted.org/neurolab/install.html).

##Description
Visualforce Development Cookbook provides solutions to a variety of challenges faced by Salesforce developers
and demonstrates how easy it is to build rich, interactive pages using Visualforce. You will start by learning about
the simple utilities and will build up to more advanced techniques for data visualization and to reuse functionality.
You will learn how to perform various tasks such as creating multiple records from a single page, visualizing data as
charts, using JavaScript to enhance client-side functionality, building a public website, and making data available to a
mobile device.
